	<p><b>I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When my mother moved to California in 2006 I was lucky enough to spend time living in both states. My father moved to a very small town called Silver City, a few hours from Albuquerque. When I graduated High School in 2012 I decided to stay in Santa Cruz permanently to pursue school and business opportunities. Now I am almost done with my BA at CSUMB and have a wonderful job.</p></b>

	<p><b>My favorite things to do include reading, watching documentaries, paying attention to my animals, cooking, and gardening. I have a large collection of books and textbooks, see a list of <a href="library.xls">my favorites</a>! Whenever possible I love to travel out of the country. I have been to Jamaica, Mexico, Fiji and Cost Rica. I have two beautiful Dalmatians and a very special cat, see their pictures below. </b></p>

	<p><b>During a majority of my school life I have moved back and forth between Santa Cruz and Silver City. In both states I attended charter schools that had very few students. I believe the charter school systems helped my gain a true appreciation for learning. Before attending CSUMB I went to Cabrillo College in Aptos where I had a wonderful experience. I have been at CSUMB for two years now and have enjoyed my time there as well. </p></b>
	
	<h3><i><font color='"#0022AE"'><a name="long-term goals">Long-Term Goals</a></font></i></h3>
	
	<p><b>It took me many years and experiences to discover what I desire in my long-term goals. At first I pursued my education in business as an outlet to financial stability. However, when I finally secured a great paying job I realized something extremely important was missing, a sense of meaningful work. After this experience I committed my full work devotion to expanding a program I have developed that supports low-income cannabis patients in Santa Cruz County. I believe that I can make a significant beneficial impact in the community in the long-term if I stay devoted to my goals.<br><br> Please contact me through one of the links below for more information!</p></b>
